# CC-Fraud-detection-with-Supervised-and-Unsupervised-ML

# Problem Ststement
The Credit Card Classification Project is a machine learning project focused on classifying credit card transactions into 2 different categories. This system is designed to help identify and categorize credit card transactions accurately. I have used both supervised and unsupervised ml algorithms.

# More about Credit Score with ML
The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook, using the Python programming language and several popular machine learning libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The data used in this project is a simulated dataset of individuals and their credit scores, which I use to train and evaluate several different machine learning models mainly focused on Logistic Regression and XGBoost model. For unsupervised, anomly detection using Isolation forest is used.
